Django Multilingual-NG
======================

Django-multilingual-ng is a branch of django-multilingual, compatible with 
Django 1.2 as well as providing admin UI improvements.

multilingual-ng tries to be compatible with django-multilingual whenever
possible. In the best case you can just replace django-multilingual-ng with
django-multilingual without having to change any code in your apps.

Note that since multilingual-ng does not use language_id's anymore, you'll have
to use the mlng_convert command to migrate your old apps to ng. For this you
need south installed.

I'll write documentation once this project hits a somewhat stable level.
